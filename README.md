## 📌 About the App  
Moka Meet is a web application designed for coffee enthusiasts to connect over their shared love for cafes and coffee shops. Users can add, review, and browse coffee shops, view other user profiles, send messages, and maintain a wishlist of favorite spots.  

The idea for Moka Meet came from my own experiences socializing at coffee shops—I wanted a way to bring that sense of community online.
